Troubleshooting and Help
------------------------

C-PAC is alpha software, which means that it is still under active development and has not yet undergone large-scale testing. As such, although we have done our best to ensure a stable pipeline, there will likely still be a few bugs that we did not catch.

Additionally, while our goal is for this User Guide to provide all the information necessary for anyone to run C-PAC, it too is still a work in progress.

If you find a bug, have a question that is not answered in the User Guide, or would like to suggest a new feature, please `visit the C-PAC help page <http://indi.zendesk.com/>`_.
