Installing C-PAC
----------------

System Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC is designed to run in a Unix-like environment such as Linux or Mac OS X, and thus does not support Windows.

Many of the analyses carried out by C-PAC are computationally intensive. Although C-PAC should run on most computers made in the past few years, we highly recommend using a system with multiple cores or multiple processors.

Install Python Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python is the glue (Bloom, 2012) that ties all the pieces of C-PAC together. Though many computers come with Python pre-installed, C-PAC relies on a number of special-purpose packages. 

If you have a .edu email address, we strongly recommend installing the `Enthought Python Distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php>`_ (EPD), which is free for academic use and includes all of the packages required by C-PAC. 

If you do not have an .edu email address, you must download and install the following packages manually before continuing:

* `SciPy and NumPy <http://www.scipy.org/Download>`_
* `NetworkX <http://networkx.lanl.gov/>`_
* `Traits <https://github.com/enthought/traits>`_
* `iPython <http://ipython.org/>`_
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
* `Setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_

**WARNING**: Manually installing the above dependencies is a complicated process, and is beyond the scope of this guide. If you are not familiar with the process of installing python packages, we suggest you seek assistance from someone who is. Future versions of C-PAC will include tools to do this automatically.

Install Nipype and Nibabel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC relies heavily on tools developed as part of the `Neuroimaging in Python (NiPy) <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipy/stable/faq/why.html>`_ project. Specifically, Nipype and Nibabel must be installed for C-PAC to run.

C-PAC currently requires a custom version of Nipype, which which is available on the `FCP-INDI Github Nipype page <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/nipype/downloads>`_. Click the button labeled "Download as tar.gz". 

Open a terminal window and unpack the file using the following command::

    tar -xzvf filename.tar.gz

Where :file:`filename.tar.gz` is the name of the file you just downloaded.

This will result in a new directory containing Nipype files. Navigate into this directory in terminal and type::

    sudo python setup.py install

You will be asked for the root password.

To install Nibabel, run the following command in terminal::

    easy_install nibabel


Install AFNI and FSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC harnesses the power of two leading neuroimaging software packages to perform key analyses: 

* `AFNI <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/>`_  (which stands for Analysis of Functional NeuroImages) is a set of programs for processing, analyzing and displaying fMRI data. `Click here for instructions on how to download and install AFNI <http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/HOWTO/howto/ht00_inst/html/index.shtml>`_.

* `FSL <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/index.html>`_ (which stands for FMRIB Software Library) is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI, and DTI brain imaging data. `Click here for instructions on how to download and install FSL <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation>`_.

**Warning:** C-PAC has only been tested with FSL version 4.1, and may not yet support the recently released version 5.0. We are working to port and test C-PAC on FSL 5.0. For now, users can still `download old versions of FSL <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/oldversions/>`_.

Editing .bashrc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have not already done so, make sure the paths to FSL and AFNI have been added to your :file:`.bashrc` file. To do this, open a new terminal window and run::

    nano ~/.bashrc

This will open :file:`.bashrc` in the nano text editor. Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following text::

    # Path to FSL
    FSLDIR=/path/to/fsl
    . ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh
    PATH=${FSLDIR}/bin:${PATH}
    export FSLDIR PATH

    # Path to AFNI
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/afni

Where :file:`/path/to/fsl` and :file:`/path/to/afni` are the locations where FSL and AFNI are installed (usually :file:`/usr/local/fsl` for FSL and :file:`~/abin` for AFNI). Save :file:`.bashrc` and exit nano.

If these changes have worked, you should be able to launch FSL and AFNI from the terminal simply by typing :file:`afni` and :file:`fsl`. 


Install FreeSurfer (optional, but required for vertex timeseries extraction)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`FreeSurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_ is a set of automated tools for reconstruction of the brain’s cortical surface from structural MRI data, and overlay of functional MRI data onto the reconstructed surface. `Click here for instructions on how to download and install FreeSurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall>`_.

Users wishing to run vertex timeseries extraction must also install the `gradunwarp python package <http://code.google.com/p/gradunwarp/>`_. To do so, run the following command in terminal::

    svn checkout http://gradunwarp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gradunwarp

This will download the latest version of the software and put it in a directory called :file:`gradunwarp`. Navigate into this directory in terminal.

If you have installed EPD, run the command::
    
    sudo python setup.py install

If you have not installed EPD, run the command::

    sudo python setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin 

In both cases, you will be asked for the root password.


Install C-PAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Congratulations, you are now ready to install C-PAC itself!

C-PAC is available from the `FCP-INDI Github C-PAC page <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/downloads>`_. Click the button labeled "Download as tar.gz". 

Open a terminal window and unpack the file using the following command::

    tar -xzvf filename.tar.gz

Where :file:`filename.tar.gz` is the name of the file you just downloaded.

This will result in a new directory containing C-PAC. Navigate into this directory in terminal and type::

    sudo python setup.py install

You will be asked for the root password.

C-PAC should now be installed and ready to run.
