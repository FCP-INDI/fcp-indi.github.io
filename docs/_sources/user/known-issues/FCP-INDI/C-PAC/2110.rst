``bids-validator`` is missing from C-PAC image
**********************************************

.. versionadded:: 1.8.6

See issue :issue:`2110` for the latest developments on this issue.

When running C-PAC with an input BIDS directory, no data configuration file and without the ``--skip_bids_validator`` flag, C-PAC will crash with a ``bids-validator: command not found`` message.

Workarounds
###########

Either of these workarounds should allow you to run versions of C-PAC affected by this issue:

- Add the ``--skip_bids_validator`` flag to your run command. If desired, run the `BIDS validator`_ on your input data prior to using C-PAC.
- Use a :doc:`data configuration file </user/subject_list_config>` to specify your input data.

Planned resolution
``````````````````

- Restoring or replacing ``bids-validator`` in an upcoming version of C-PAC.
