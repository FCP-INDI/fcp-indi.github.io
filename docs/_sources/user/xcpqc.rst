XCP quality control files
=========================

As part of the ReproBrainChart (RBC) project, C-PAC includes quality control summary files (``desc-xcp_quality``) for each ``desc-preproc_bold`` output based on the `eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline (XCP) quality control dictionary <https://xcpengine.readthedocs.io/qualitycontrol.html>`_.
