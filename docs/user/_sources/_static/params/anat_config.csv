resolution_for_anat,The resolution to which anatomical images should be transformed during registration.,"1 An interger indicating three same dimensions (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4); 
2 A float number indicating three same dimensions (e.g., 3.5 etc.); 3 Three numbers connected by 'x' indicating three different dimensions (e.g., 2.67x2.67x3 etc.)"
template_brain_only_for_anat,Reference template for resampling during registration. Normally the default value (seen in the example YAML) is fine.,"A path (e.g., $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz)."
template_skull_for_anat,Reference template for resampling during registration. Normally the default value (seen in the example YAML) is fine.,"A path (e.g., $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz)."
regOption,Use either ANTS or FSL (FLIRT and FNIRT) as your anatomical registration method.,"A list containing ‘ANTS’, ‘FSL’, or both (e.g., [‘FSL’])."
fnirtConfig,Configuration file to be used by FSL to set FNIRT parameters.,"A template name (e.g., ‘T1_2_MNI152_2mm’)."
ref_mask,Configuration file to be used by FSL to set FNIRT parameters.,"A path (e.g., $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain_mask_dil.nii.gz)."
regWithSkull,Register skull-on anatomical image to a template.,"A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
already_skullstripped,Disables skull-stripping on the anatomical inputs if they are already skull-stripped.,"A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
