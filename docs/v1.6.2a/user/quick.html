<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The recommended way to run C-PAC is through the use of a container such as Docker or Singularity. Using these containers can be facilitated by <a class="reference internal" href="cpac"><span class="doc">cpac (Python package)</span></a>.</li>
<li>Containers are completely pre-built environments that help ensure reproducibility (same exact library versions, behavior, etc.).</li>
<li>Docker is the more common option, but may require administrative rights on your system. This is a good option for personal machines.</li>
<li>Singularity is the preferred option for shared resources like servers and clusters with many users. Either you or a system administrator can pull a C-PAC Singularity container for global use across your lab or organization.</li>
<li>C-PAC comes pre-packaged with a default pipeline, as well as a growing library of pre-configured pipelines. You can use these to get started right away.</li>
<li>However, you can edit any of these pipelines, or build your own from scratch, using our pipeline builder.</li>
<li>C-PAC can also pull input data from the cloud (AWS S3 buckets), so you can pull public data from any of the open-data releases immediately.</li>
<li>More information regarding all of these points are available below, and throughout the rest of the User Guide.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cpac-python-package">
<h2>cpac (Python package)<a class="headerlink" href="#cpac-python-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cpac/">cpac</a> is available so that you can easily run analyses without needing interact with the container platform that allows you to run C-PAC without installing all of the underlying software.</p>
<p>Currently the cpac supports Singularity (version ≥ 2.5 ≤ 3.0) and Docker.</p>
<p>cpac requires Python 3.6 or greater. To get cpac, simply</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">pip install cpac</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As a quick example, in order to run C-PAC in participant mode, for one participant, using a BIDS dataset stored on your machine or server, and using the container image’s default pipeline configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">cpac run /Users/You/local_bids_data /Users/You/some_folder_for_outputs participant</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By default, the cpac will try Docker first and fall back to Singularity if Docker fails. If both fail, an exception is raised.</p>
<p>You can specify a platform with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--platform</span> <span class="pre">docker</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--platform</span> <span class="pre">singularity</span></code>. If you specify a platform without specifying an image, these are the defaults, using the first successfully found image:</p>
<div class="section" id="usage">

<ul class="simple">
<li>Look for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fcpindi/c-pac:latest</span></code> locally.</li>
<li>Pull <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fcpindi/c-pac:latest</span></code> from Docker Hub.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="platform-singularity">
<h4><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--platform</span> <span class="pre">singularity</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#platform-singularity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Look in the present working directory for any Singularity images. If more than one is found, use the most recently modified.</li>
<li>Pull <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FCP-INDI/C-PAC</span></code> from Singularity Hub.</li>
<li>Pull <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fcpindi/c-pac:latest</span></code> from Docker Hub and convert to a Singularity image.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also specify a container image with an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--image</span></code> argument, passing an image name (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fcpindi/c-pac</span></code>) for a Docker image or a filepath (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/singularity_images/C-PAC.sif</span></code>) for a Singularity image. You can also specify a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--tag</span></code> (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">latest</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nightly</span></code>).</p>
<p>You can also provide a link to an AWS S3 bucket containing a BIDS directory as the data source:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">cpac run s3://fcp-indi/data/Projects/ADHD200/RawDataBIDS /Users/You/some_folder_for_outputs participant</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In addition to the default pipeline, C-PAC comes packaged with a growing library of pre-configured pipelines that are ready to use. To run C-PAC with one of the pre-packaged pre-configured pipelines, simply invoke the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--preconfig</span></code> flag, shown below. See the full selection of pre-configured pipelines <span class="xref std std-doc">here</span>.</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">cpac run /Users/You/local_bids_data /Users/You/some_folder_for_outputs --preconfig anat-only</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To run C-PAC with a pipeline configuration file other than one of the pre-configured pipelines, assuming the configuration file is in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/Users/You/Documents</span></code> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">cpac run /Users/You/local_bids_data /Users/You/some_folder_for_outputs participant --pipeline_file /Users/You/Documents/pipeline_config.yml</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, to run C-PAC with a specific data configuration file (instead of providing a BIDS data directory):</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">cpac run /Users/You/any_directory /Users/You/some_folder_for_outputs participant --data_config_file /Users/You/Documents/data_config.yml</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note: we are still providing the postionally-required <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bids_dir</span></code> input parameter. However C-PAC will not look for data in this directory when you provide a data configuration YAML with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--data_config_file</span></code> flag. Providing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PWD</span></code> will simply pass the present working directory. In addition, if the dataset in your data configuration file is not in BIDS format, just make sure to add the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--skip_bids_validator</span></code> flag at the end of your command to bypass the BIDS validation process.</p>
<p>The full list of parameters and options that can be passed to C-PAC are shown below:</p>
<p>Note that any of the optional arguments above will over-ride any pipeline settings in the default pipeline or in the pipeline configuration file you provide via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--pipeline_file</span></code> parameter.</p>
<p><strong>Further usage notes:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can run only anatomical preprocessing easily, without modifying your data or pipeline configuration files, by providing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--anat_only</span></code> flag.</li>
<li>As stated, the default behavior is to read data that is organized in the BIDS format. This includes data that is in Amazon AWS S3 by using the format <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s3://&lt;bucket_name&gt;/&lt;bids_dir&gt;</span></code> for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bids_dir</span></code> command line argument. Outputs can be written to S3 using the same format for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">output_dir</span></code>. Credentials for accessing these buckets can be specified on the command line (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--aws_input_creds</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--aws_output_creds</span></code>).</li>
<li>When the app is run, a data configuration file is written to the working directory. This directory can be specified with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--working_dir</span></code> or the directory from which you run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cpac</span></code> will be used. This file can be passed into subsequent runs, which avoids the overhead of re-parsing the BIDS input directory on each run (i.e. for cluster or cloud runs). These files can be generated without executing the C-PAC pipeline using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test_run</span></code> command line argument.</li>
<li>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">participant_label</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">participant_ndx</span></code> arguments allow the user to specify which of the many datasets should be processed, which is useful when parallelizing the run of multiple participants.</li>
<li>If you want to pass runtime options to your container plaform (Docker or Singularity), you can pass them with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-o</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--container_options</span></code>.</li>

<h2>Default Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#default-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>C-PAC is packaged with a default processing pipeline so that you can get your data preprocessing and analysis started immediately. Just pull the C-PAC Docker container and kick off the container with your data, and you’re on your way.</p>
<p>The default processing pipeline performs fMRI processing using four strategies, with and without global signal regression, with and without bandpass filtering.</p>
<p>Anatomical processing begins with conforming the data to RPI orientation and removing orientation header information that will interfere with further processing. A non-linear transform between skull-on images and a 2mm MNI brain-only template are calculated using ANTs [3]. Images are them skull-stripped using AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip [5] and subsequently segmented into WM, GM, and CSF using FSL’s fast tool [6]. The resulting WM mask was multiplied by a WM prior map that was transformed into individual space using the inverse of the linear transforms previously calculated during the ANTs procedure. A CSF mask was multiplied by a ventricle map derived from the Harvard-Oxford atlas distributed with FSL [4]. Skull-stripped images and grey matter tissue maps are written into MNI space at 2mm resolution.</p>
<p>Functional preprocessing begins with resampling the data to RPI orientation, and slice timing correction. Next, motion correction is performed using a two-stage approach in which the images are first coregistered to the mean fMRI and then a new mean is calculated and used as the target for a second coregistration (AFNI 3dvolreg [2]). A 7 degree of freedom linear transform between the mean fMRI and the structural image is calculated using FSL’s implementation of boundary-based registration [7]. Nuisance variable regression (NVR) is performed on motion corrected data using a 2nd order polynomial, a 24-regressor model of motion [8], 5 nuisance signals, identified via principal components analysis of signals obtained from white matter (CompCor, [9]), and mean CSF signal. WM and CSF signals were extracted using the previously described masks after transforming the fMRI data to match them in 2mm space using the inverse of the linear fMRI-sMRI transform. The NVR procedure is performed twice, with and without the inclusion of the global signal as a nuisance regressor. The residuals of the NVR procedure are processed with and without bandpass filtering (0.001Hz &lt; f &lt; 0.1Hz), written into MNI space at 3mm resolution and subsequently smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel.</p>
<p>Several different individual level analysis are performed on the fMRI data including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (alff) [10]:</strong> the variance of each voxel is calculated after bandpass filtering in original space and subsequently written into MNI space at 2mm resolution and spatially smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (falff) [11]:</strong> Similar to alff except that the variance of the bandpassed signal is divided by the total variance (variance of non-bandpassed signal.</li>
<li><strong>Regional homogeniety (ReHo) [12]:</strong> a simultaneous Kendalls correlation is calculated between each voxel’s time course and the time courses of the 27 voxels that are face, edge, and corner touching the voxel. ReHo is calculated in original space and subsequently written into MNI space at 2mm resolution and spatially smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Voxel mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) [13]:</strong> an non-linear transform is calculated between the skull-on anatomical data and a symmetric brain template in 2mm space. Using this transform, processed fMRI data are written in to symmetric MNI space at 2mm and the correlation between each voxel and its analog in the contralateral hemisphere is calculated. The Fisher transform is applied to the resulting values, which are then spatially smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted and binarized degree centrality (DC) [14]:</strong> fMRI data is written into MNI space at 2mm resolution and spatially smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel. The voxel x voxel similarity matrix is calculated by the correlation between every pair of voxel time courses and then thresholded so that only the top 5% of correlations remain. For each voxel, binarized DC is the number of connections that remain for the voxel after thresholding and weighted DC is the average correlation coefficient across the remaining connections.</li>
<li><strong>Eigenvector centrality (EC) [15]:</strong> fMRI data is written into MNI space at 2mm resolution and spatially smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel. The voxel x voxel similarity matrix is calculated by the correlation between every pair of voxel time courses and then thresholded so that only the top 5% of correlations remain. Weighted EC is calculated from the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue from an eigenvector decomposition of the resulting similarity. Binarized EC, is the first eigenvector of the similarity matrix after setting the non-zero values in the resulting matrix are set to 1.</li>
<li><strong>Local functional connectivity density (lFCD) [16]:</strong> fMRI data is written into MNI space at 2mm resolution and spatially smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel. For each voxel, lFCD corresponds to the number of contiguous voxels that are correlated with the voxel above 0.6 (r&gt;0.6). This is similar to degree centrality, except only voxels that it only includes the voxels that are directly connected to the seed voxel.</li>
<li><strong>10 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from dual regression [17]:</strong> a template including 10 ICNs from a meta-analysis of resting state and task fMRI data [18] is spatially regressed against the processed fMRI data in MNI space. The resulting time courses are entered into a multiple regression with the voxel data in original space to calculate individual representations of the 10 ICNs. The resulting networks are written into MNI space at 2mm and then spatially smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Seed correlation analysis (SCA):</strong> preprocessed fMRI data is to match template that includes 160 regions of interest defined from a meta-analysis of different task results [19]. A time series is calculated for each region from the mean of all intra-ROI voxel time series. A separate functional connectivity map is calculated per ROI by correlating its time course with the time courses of every other voxel in the brain. Resulting values are Fisher transformed, written into MNI space at 2mm resolution, and then spatial smoothed using a 6mm FWHM kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Time series extraction:</strong> similar the procedure used for time series analysis, the preprocessed functional data is written into MNI space at 2mm and then time series for the various atlases are extracted by averaging within region voxel time courses. This procedure was used to generate summary time series for the automated anatomic labelling atlas [20], Eickhoff-Zilles atlas [21], Harvard-Oxford atlas [22], Talaraich and Tournoux atlas [23], 200 and 400 regions from the spatially constrained clustering voxel timeseries [24], and 160 ROIs from a meta-analysis of task results [19]. Time series for 10 ICNs were extracted using spatial regression.</li>
