Preprocessing Setup
-------------------

Timeseries Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
startIdx and stopIdx
""""""""""""""""""""
Users wishing to discard the first few volumes of a scan (to facilitate stable magnetization) can specify a starting volume here::

	# Ignore volumes before this timepoint
	# Options are an integer or None (defaults to beginning of timeseries)
	startIdx = 0

Users can also chose to ignore volumes after a specific timepoint::

	# Ignore volumes after this timepoint
	# Options are an integer or None (defaults to end of timeseries)
	stopIdx = None

TR
"""
If the actual TR used during scanning is different than what is specified in the image header, you can specify that value here::

	# Specify a TR (in seconds) other than what is listen in image headers
	# Options are a number or None (defaults to header information)
	TR = None

Resolution and Smoothing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
standardResolution
""""""""""""""""""
Set the standard resolution to which images should be transformed for analysis::

	# Set the resolution (in mm) to which images are transformed
	# Transformation occurs during registration and is requried for many measures
	standardResolution = '3mm'

fwhm
""""
Set the width of the Gaussian kernel used during spatial smoothing::

	# Width (FWHM, in mm) of the Gaussian kernel used for spatial smoothing
	# To skip smoothing, set to 0
	fwhm = [4]

Preprocessing Workflow Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Part of the power of C-PAC is the ability for users to selectively run processing and analysis workflows. That being said, users should be aware that choosing not to run certain workflows may result in other workflows failing to run. Please review the `C-PAC developer documentation <http://fcp-indi.github.com/C-PAC/docs/developer/index.html>`_ for information on workflow dependencies.
