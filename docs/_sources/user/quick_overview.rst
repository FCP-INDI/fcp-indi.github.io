Let's Go!
---------

#. The recommended way to run C-PAC is through the use of a container such as Docker or Singularity. Using these containers can be facilitated by :doc:`cpac`. C-PAC is also available as a |brainlife.io/app|.

#. Containers are completely pre-built environments that help ensure reproducibility (same exact library versions, behavior, etc.).

#. Docker is the more common option, but may require administrative rights on your system. This is a good option for personal machines.

#. Singularity is the preferred option for shared resources like servers and clusters with many users. Either you or a system administrator can pull a C-PAC Singularity container for global use across your lab or organization.

#. C-PAC comes pre-packaged with a default pipeline, as well as a growing library of pre-configured pipelines. You can use these to get started right away.

#. However, you can edit any of these pipelines, or build your own from scratch, using our pipeline builder.

#. C-PAC can also pull input data from the cloud (AWS S3 buckets), so you can pull public data from any of the open-data releases immediately.

#. More information regarding all of these points are available below, and throughout the rest of the User Guide.
