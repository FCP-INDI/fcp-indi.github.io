``bids-validator`` is missing from C-PAC image
**********************************************

.. versionadded:: 1.8.6

.. versionremoved:: 1.8.8

Issue :issue:`2110` resolved in :issue:`2120`

When running C-PAC with an input BIDS directory, no data configuration file and without the ``--skip_bids_validator`` flag, C-PAC would crash with a ``bids-validator: command not found`` message. The ``bids-validator`` CLI was restored to the C-PAC container images in version 1.8.8.
