<h2>Version 1.4.0 Beta - 2019.02.04<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-4-0-beta-2019-02-04" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Quick Start Guide.</strong> By pulling our Docker or Singularity container, you can kick off C-PAC with your dataset in minutes, without any prior package or library installations other than Docker or Singularity. More info available on our <a class="reference internal" href="quick.html"><span class="doc">User Guide</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>TURNKEY MODE.</strong> For users who prefer not to make decisions regarding their pipeline, C-PAC now includes a pre-configured default pipeline that includes the most commonly used decisions. The pre-configured pipeline selections are described in the <a class="reference internal" href="quick.html"><span class="doc">Quick-start guide</span></a> under “Running Turnkey Mode”.</li>
<li><strong>Nonparametric Permutation Inference.</strong> FMRIB’s FSL Randomise has been integrated into C-PAC’s suite of group-level analyses. You can use the already-existing FSL group-level presets or the group model builder to specify your model.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Group Model-Building Modularity.</strong> As part of an ongoing process of improving usability, C-PAC’s group-level analysis model builder now offers more control over your model design. It is now easier to review changes to your design matrix before specifying contrasts.</li>
<li><strong>Early Access to the new C-PAC GUI.</strong> The first part of C-PAC’s new graphical user interface (GUI) for generating and editing custom pipelines is available! All are encouraged to take a quick test-drive of the pipeline builder and let us know your thoughts. All feedback welcome on our <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpax_forum">forum</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Error Fixes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">

<h2>Version 1.2.0 Beta - 2018.08.10<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-2-0-beta-2018-08-10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR).</strong> Exploratory, connectome-wide group-level analysis that allows researchers to explore relationships between patterns of functional connectivity and phenotypic variables. Compared to traditional univariate techniques which require rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, this multivariate approach significantly reduces the number of connectivity-phenotype comparisons needed for connectome-wide associations studies. See: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583255">A multivariate distance-based analytic framework for connectome-wide association studies.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Improved Command-Line Interface.</strong> C-PAC is now much easier to use through the command-line interface using the “cpac” CLI tool. Users can kick off individual and group-level analyses using a nested menu, generate new pipeline and data configuration files, and set up FSL FEAT model presets, all without using the Graphical User Interface. More details available <a class="reference internal" href="running.html"><span class="doc">here.</span></a></li>
<li><strong>Increased Skull-Stripping Configurability.</strong> You can now modify the full range of parameters for both AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip and FSL’s BET for anatomical skull-stripping during preprocessing.</li>
<li><strong>Default pipeline configuration.</strong> For those who don’t want the options, C-PAC can run as a turnkey system using parameter selections recommended by our team. More details available <a class="reference internal" href="running.html"><span class="doc">here.</span></a></li>
<li><strong>Group-level Analysis Usability.</strong> Group-level analyses now also accept tab-separated (.tsv) files for phenotypic information. This allows users to seamlessly pull in the participants.tsv files which often accompany BIDS datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Error Fixes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An error in v1.1.0 that was causing the QC pages to crash on SNR image generation in some pipeline runs has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coming Soon (Release 1.3 early Fall)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bootstrap Analysis for Stable Clusters (BASC)</li>
<li>Inter-subject Correlation (ISC)</li>
<li>Independent Components Analysis (ICA)-based Denoising</li>
<li>More FSL Group-Level Analysis presets</li>
<li>Supervised learning</li>

<h2>Version 1.1.0 Beta - 2018.05.15<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-1-0-beta-2018-05-15" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>The Visual Data Quality Control Interface is back!</strong> The QC interface provides HTML pages for each participant, scan, and preprocessing strategy featuring montage images of various preprocessing, analysis, and head motion images, graphs, and histograms. You can use these for a quick glance of your results.</li>
<li><strong>FSL FEAT Group-Level Analysis Presets.</strong> A new addition to C-PAC’s group-level analysis model builder that allows you to setup group-level models specified in the FSL User Guide with little effort. The preset generator allows you to select from a few commonly-used FEAT model configurations. The first six model types are in and more to come! <a class="reference internal" href="group_analysis.html"><span class="doc">More details here.</span></a></li>
<li><strong>Automated Anatomical Scan Selection (for Multisession datasets).</strong> If using a dataset that features multiple anatomical/structural scans per participant, you can now configure the data configuration builder to automatically select which anatomical file to use in your pre-processing run. <a class="reference internal" href="subject_list_config.html"><span class="doc">More details here.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Leaner and Cleaner Output Directories.</strong> The layout of the output directory has been made cleaner and easier to navigate. Many of the usual outputs written to the output directory by default are now optional, saving disk space as well. There are new options in the pipeline configuration enabling you to select which additional outputs should be included in the output directory. Again, see the User Guide for more information on this change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Remarks</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The data configuration YAML file format has been modified to feature deeper nesting of functional-related files (such as scan parameter files or field map files). Note, data configuration files from versions prior to v1.1.0 will not work with C-PAC v1.1.0 or later - you can use any already-existing data settings YAML files to regenerate these. See the User Guide for more information, or feel free to contact us if any assistance is needed. <a class="reference internal" href="subject_list_config.html"><span class="doc">More details here.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Error Fixes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The z-stat output files of group-level analysis are now labeled after the contrast names provided by the user during the group model creation process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coming Soon (Releases 1.2 and 1.3 this summer)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR)</li>
<li>Bootstrap Analysis for Stable Cluster (BASC)</li>
<li>More FSL Group-Level Analysis presets</li>
<li>Expanded range of skull stripping options</li>
<li>Expanded nuisance regression options</li>

<h2>Version 1.0.3 Beta - 2018.01.26<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0-3-beta-2018-01-26" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>General Remarks</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Subject/Participant list YAML file has been renamed the “Data Configuration” file. What used to be named the “data config”, which contains the presets used to generate the participant list, has been renamed the “Data Settings” file. This also makes the main CPAC interface consistent with the CPAC BIDS-App. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/subject_list_config.html">User Guide section about building a data configuration file</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>
<p>New Features</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Field map distortion correction via FSL FUGUE has been introduced as a pre-processing option. Users can provide the phase difference and magnitude files required to generate the field map (if applicable) through the data configuration (participant list) builder. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/func.html#field-map-based-distortion-correction">User Guide section about distortion correction</a> for more information.</li>
<li>A new script called cpac_data_config_setup.py has been introduced, which allows users to quickly and easily create a data settings template for modification, and then use this data settings file to generate their data configuration. This script does the same thing that the data configuration builder GUI does, except without needing to be able to open the GUI (for example, when SSHing into a server). Information on its usage is available <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/subject_list_config.html#creating-the-data-configuration-file-from-terminal">here</a>.</li>
<li>When building your data configuration (participant list), input data can now be filtered by site, session, and series.</li>
<li>For building your data configuration (participant list), support for BIDS-protocol scan parameter reading from JSON files has been introduced.</li>
<li>Logging can now be disabled by entering “run_logging: False” in your pipeline configuration YAML file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Improvements</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The layout and naming of fields in the data configuration builder GUI are now clearer.</li>
<li>More informative status messages have been introduced detailing the data configuration building process (progress, amount of input data found, etc.).</li>
<li>Data configuration files (participant lists) are now ordered by site, and then participant ID, for easier searching and navigation when manually viewing or editing the YAML file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Error Fixes</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The bug in the group-level analysis model builder GUI reported earlier, where the ordering of the contrasts in the contrast matrix provided to FSL FLAME did not always match the order in which they were specified in the group model builder GUI, has been fixed.</li>
<li>An error introduced in v1.0.2 that was causing the CompCor nuisance regression strategy to not run even if it was selected in some cases, has been fixed.</li>
<li>When generating a data configuration file (participant list), a bug sometimes causing some scans to not be included in a participant entry has been fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes de-spiking could cause a crash if no volumes are marked for excessive motion.</li>
<li>The formatting of the motion parameters CSV file has been fixed.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-1-0-2-beta-2017-11-03">
<h2>Version 1.0.2 Beta - 2017.11.03<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0-2-beta-2017-11-03" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>CPAC now offers De-Spiking as an option in nuisance regression, which regresses out the impact of motion-induced artifacts from the functional timeseries from volumes exhibiting motion greater than a specified threshold, without removing those volumes.</li>
<li>Users can now select which Framewise Displacement (FD) calculation to use (Jenkinson’s or Power’s) when applying the motion threshold for either Scrubbing or De-Spiking.</li>
<li>Scrubbing has been moved to the Nuisance Regression tab in the GUI’s pipeline configuration editor. The pipeline configuration YAML keys have changed for scrubbing settings. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/nuisance.html#configuration-without-the-gui">User Guide Nuisance Regression page</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/blob/master/configs/pipeline_config.yml#L335">sample pipeline configuration file</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Re-introduced the ability to stop pipeline runs easily from the GUI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the data configuration (subject list) builder that would cause non-NIfTI files to be included if the user did not explicitly define the file extension in the file template.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the data configuration (subject list) builder where some fields would not get populated when re-loading the settings in the GUI.</li>
<li>Added better error-catching and messages in nuisance regression which warn the user if nuisance parameters are too stringent for the regression to complete properly.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="version-1-0-1b-beta-2017-09-07">
<h2>Version 1.0.1b Beta - 2017.09.07<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0-1b-beta-2017-09-07" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>CPAC is now compatible with Nipype version 0.13.</li>
<li>AWS S3 bucket support for BIDS data format participant list builder.</li>
<li>The pipeline configuration editor’s “Test Configuration” feature now works with participant lists that contain AWS S3 paths.</li>
<li>The cpac_install.sh and cpac_setup.py scripts have been fixed to be compatible with recent changes.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the group-level analysis model builder that would prevent the user from running group analysis on outputs from Seed-Based Correlation Analysis.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the group-level analysis pipeline where AFNI 3ddot would fail when performing a check on the merged 4D derivative file.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where crash files would be generated at the beginning of the pipeline for the ‘check_for_s3’ nodes even when not pulling data from an S3 bucket.</li>
<li>Added more checks for file permissions and scan names at the beginning of the pipeline run.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-1-0-1-beta-2016-12-09">
<h2>Version 1.0.1 Beta - 2016.12.09<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0-1-beta-2016-12-09" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Participant list builder fixes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The {participant}, {session}, etc. tags once again work properly, and are now more flexible for custom filepath formats. For example, multiple tags on one directory level, combinations of tags and custom string prefixes/suffixes, and multiple instances of the same tag in one path template are now all supported.</li>
<li>When providing a participant inclusion list (under Subjects to Include) and a site inclusion list (under Sites to Include) at the same time, the builder used to ignore the Sites to Include input. This is no longer the case and will generate an intersection of the Sites and Participant inclusion lists provided.</li>
<li>Including a scan parameters CSV containing information for multiple sites during participant list generation will no longer include scan parameters for sites not included in your data.</li>
<li>Addition of informative messages while constructing the participant list- will warn the user when a participant included in Subjects to Include does not exist or could not be found in the data, and will list these missing participant IDs.</li>
<li>When the input data does not have a session level, the participant list builder will now provide the default session “ses-1” instead of requiring a session level to be included. This is the case for both BIDS and custom data formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>Installation script updates:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Now more robust to package name differences between different versions of Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Now uses the Neurodebian ants package for all versions of Ubuntu except for 14.04.</li>
<li>Compiles libxp for Ubuntu &gt;= 16.04 for AFNI.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other updates:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The nuisance regressors are now written out to a 1D file found under “functional_nuisance_regressors” in the output directory.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where locally-stored input files would  potentially deleted if the user would use the “Test Configuration” feature with a participant list that contained both S3 links and local filepath file templates.</li>
<li>A few redundant and unnecessary directories in the individual-level analysis output directory have been removed. These were re-writes of the ANTS-based anatomical registration warp files.</li>
<li>The pipeline configuration file editor now includes the CPAC version number in the configuration YAML file.</li>
<li>More informative error messages for when there is a problem in the pipeline configuration, such as the presence of unreferenced variable names in file paths.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Version 1.0.0 Beta - 2016.11.03<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0-0-beta-2016-11-03" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>CPAC now calculates network centrality derivatives using the new 3dDegreeCentrality, 3dEigenvectorCentrality, and 3dLFCD AFNI tools implemented by our developers. These implementations are optimized to minimize the memory requirements while speeding up computation time. If you have an already#.existing installation of AFNI that does not have these newer tools, you can update your installation by running “&#64;update.afni.binaries” from your AFNI installation directory.</li>
<li>CPAC inputs can now be directly downloaded from and outputs can be directly uploaded to AWS S3 cloud storage.</li>
<li>SLURM cluster resource scheduler compatibility added.</li>
<li>We removed user specified segmentation thresholds from the segmentation workflow and instead rely on the default thresholds used by FSL’s FAST tool. This removes the issue of choosing an appropriate threshold, which would previously result in no WM or CSF signals for nuisance correction.</li>
<li>The GUI has been reorganized to simplify pipeline configuration, and specifically to improve handling of nuisance correction strategies and specifying ROIs for time series extraction and seed correlation analysis.</li>
<li>Group-level analysis has been over-hauled to make it run more quickly, handle repeated measures, make entering contrasts more intuitive, and improve transparency in to the model generation process.</li>
<li>Nipype and CPAC have been updated to use a resource aware scheduler that incorporates information about the amount of memory and cores currently available when choosing a pipeline step to run. This should maximize running different pipeline steps in parallel while reducing the occurrence of out-of-memory errors and system lock-ups.</li>
<li>The output resolution in MNI space for statistical derivatives (e.g., ReHo, DC, etc) and 4D preprocessed functional data can be specified separately. The user can now also decide not to write the 4D preprocessed data into MNI space. Both of these steps can significantly reduce memory and disk space requirements.</li>
<li>Improved logging.</li>
<li>Column names of ROI time series files and file names for SCA outputs are now based on the unique identifier used for the ROI in the corresponding atlas, making it easier to relate the files back to the ROIs.</li>
<li>For the subject list generated, we replaced the confusing “%s” identifiers in file path templates with {participant}, {site}, {session} to make generating these templates more user friendly.</li>
<li>Added support for BIDS file structure.</li>

<li>A custom ROI mask file can now be provided with one or more ROIs - the mean of these ROIs will then be calculated and included as regressors in the model. This will enable for example, including seperate regressors for white matter and CSF.</li>
<li>The statistical derivatives to be analyzed can now be specified for each group model, allowing the user more flexibility for using different group models (i.e. include different nuisance regressors) for different derivatives.</li>
