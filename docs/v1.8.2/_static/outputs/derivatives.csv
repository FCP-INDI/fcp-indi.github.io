<derivative>_zstd, The z-score standardized output for a derivative (exception for VMHC- see VMHC table for more details).
<derivative>_zstat, The z-score standardized output for a derivative (used for SCA and dual regression; means something different for VMHC - see VMHC table for more details).
<derivative>_fisher_zstd - The z-score standardized output for a derivative using Fisher's z-score transformation.
output_means, A directory containing a series of nested sub-directories of the following form (with subdirectories representing optional steps only included if those steps were run): _scan_rest/_csf_threshold_<threshold>/_gm_threshold_<threshold>/_wm_threshold_<threshold>/<nuisance_regressors>/_hp_<high frequency cut-off>/_lp_<low frequency cut off>/.  At the lowest level of these subdirectories are text files that contain the average values for each derivative run.  These individual means are also aggregated into a single file of the form 'output_means_<subject name>.csv' in the individua subject output directory.
<output>_to_standard, A derivative or other intermediate output transformed into MNI space.

Smoothing
<derivative>_smooth,  directory containing a series of nested sub-directories of the following form (with subdirectories representing optional steps only included if those steps were run): _scan_rest/_csf_threshold_<threshold>/_gm_threshold_<threshold>/_wm_threshold_<threshold>/<nuisance_regressors>/_hp_<high frequency cut-off>/_lp_<low frequency cut off>/_fwhm_<kernel_fwhm>.  At the lowest level of these subdirectories are smoothed NifTI files.

Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) - Analyze the connectivity between brain regions.
sca_roi_correlation_files, The results of seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from ROIs using 3dTcorr1D.  Results for multiple ROIs are contained in separate files.
sca_roi_correlation_stack, The results of seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from ROIs using 3dTcorr1D.  Results for ROIs are concatenated together into a single 4D NifTI file.
sca_seed_correlation_files, The results of seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from seed specifications using 3dTcorr1D.
sca_tempreg_maps_files, The results of multiple regression seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from ROIs.  GLM parameter estimate images for each timeseries in the input file. Results for multiple ROIs are contained in separate files.
sca_tempreg_maps_stack, The results of multiple regression seed-based correlation analysis for extracted time series from ROIs.  GLM parameter estimate images for each timeseries in the input file. Results for ROIs are concatenated together into a single 4D NifTI file.

Dual Regression - Compare large-scale networks.
spatial_map_timeseries, The GLM-derived time series associated with voxels in a spatial map for the participant.
dr_tempreg_maps_files, The subject-specific spatial maps generated by running temporal regression.  Results for multiple regions in the spatial map are contained in separate files.
dr_tempreg_maps_stack, The subject-specific spatial maps generated by running temporal regression.  Results for multiple regions in the spatial map are concatenated together into a single 4D NifTI file.

Voxel-mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC) - Investigate connectivity between hemispheres.
vmhc_fisher_zstd_zstat_map, The Z statistic map for VMHC.
vmhc_fisher_zstd, The Fisher Z transfrom map for VMHC.
vmhc_raw_score, The VMHC results in a 3D NifTI file.

Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) - Measure the power of slow fluctuations in brain activity.
alff_img, The ALFF results in a 3D NifTI file.
falff_img, The f/ALFF results in a 3D NifTI file.

Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) - Measure the similarity of activity patterns across neighboring voxels.
raw_reho_map, The results for ReHo in a 3D NifTI file.

Network Centrality - Analyze the structure of functional networks.
centrality_outputs, A directory containing degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and lfcd results as NifTI files.
