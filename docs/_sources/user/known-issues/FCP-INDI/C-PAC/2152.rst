🐛 First two TRs not affected by bandpass filter
************************************************

.. versionadded:: 1.8.6

.. versionremoved:: 1.8.8

Issue :issue:`2152` resolved in :issue:`2153`

When running C-PAC v1.8.6 or v1.8.7 with a bandpass filter, the ``1D`` file is treated as if the header is 5 rows regardless of how many rows are in the actual header (typically 3 rows).

This bug originated in v1.8.6 and was resolved in v1.8.8.

Workarounds
###########

Preferred
`````````

Use an unaffected version of C-PAC if using bandpass filters.

Alternative
```````````

If you're using an affected version of C-PAC, you can make sure the 1D files have 5-row headers. This may require deleting some downstream working files and outputs and rerunning after modifying the intermediate ``1D`` file(s).
