FSL-FEAT/Randomise Group Analysis
=================================
Overview
^^^^^^^^

C-PAC uses the `FSL/FEAT <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide>`_ tool to compare findings across groups. You can construct models using a participant list and a phenotype file, select derivatives to be predicted by the model, and define contrasts between conditions using a custom CSV file. Then FSL/FEAT will run a second-level `General Linear Model (GLM) <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide#Appendix_A:_Brief_Overview_of_GLM_Analysis>`_ for you.

In addition, FMRIB's FSL Randomise package is also available in C-PAC for the execution of non-parametric permutation inference. FSL-Randomise can use the same group models you generate or build/edit via the C-PAC model builder for FSL-FEAT.

There are two ways to set up FSL-FEAT/Randomise group-level analysis for C-PAC:

* **The FLAME Model Presets**: this allows you to generate a pre-configured analysis model.
* **The Group Analysis Model Builder**: this allows you to specify a model from scratch, or to modify any of the generated presets mentioned above.

The following links provide an introduction to how groups are compared using FSL, as well as how to define contrasts:

Group Analysis FSL-FEAT/Randomise Presets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-PAC has a selection of model presets designed to run commonly-used group analysis designs for FSL-FEAT/FLAME. These correspond to examples provided on `FSL's user guide for FEAT/FLAME <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide>`_. The preset generator will create a group analysis YAML configuration file that you can plug directly into C-PAC and run.

The presets that are generated:

* are meant to get you up and running quickly
* are in the form of a group analysis configuration YAML file that can be plugged directly into C-PAC and run
* include a complete design matrix as an input, which you can view before running
* include already-configured contrasts in a custom contrasts .CSV file, which can be edited before running
* can be modified to your liking either by using the standard Group Analysis Model Builder, or by hand via text editor
* are all in one place in the output directory you specify in the Preset Generator

**Preset options**: Currently, there are 5 presets to choose from. More are on their way. If you have any commonly-used or useful group model designs you'd like to see as a preset, please let us know on `GitHub <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Cuser-reported%2Cgroup-level+analysis&template=feature_request.yml&title=%E2%9C%A8+New+Preset+Group+Model+Design:+%5Bdesign+name%5D>`_ or `Neurostars <https://neurostars.org/tag/cpac>`_!

The available presets are:

* `Single Group Average (One-Sample T-Test) <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide#Single-Group_Average_.28One-Sample_T-Test.29>`_
* `Single Group Average with Additional Covariate <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide#Single-Group_Average_with_Additional_Covariate>`_
* `Unpaired Two-Group Difference (Two-Sample Unpaired T-Test) <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide#Unpaired_Two-Group_Difference_.28Two-Sample_Unpaired_T-Test.29>`_
* `Paired Two-Group Difference (Two-Sample Paired T-Test) <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide#Paired_Two-Group_Difference_.28Two-Sample_Paired_T-Test.29>`_
* `Tripled Two-Group Difference ('Tripled' T-Test) <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide#Tripled_Two-Group_Difference_.28.22Tripled.22_T-Test.29>`_

From Terminal
-------------
You can generate any of these presets using the C-PAC command-line interface (CLI):

.. code-block:: console

    cpac group feat load-preset <preset type>

Enter any of the following in place of :file:`<preset type>` for the type of analysis you want to run:

* **single_grp_avg** - Single Group Average (One-Sample T-Test)
* **single_grp_cov** - Single Group Average with Additional Covariate
* **unpaired_two** - Unpaired Two-Group Difference (Two-Sample Unpaired T-Test)
* **paired_two** - Paired Two-Group Difference (Two-Sample Paired T-Test)
* **tripled_two** - Tripled Two-Group Difference ('Tripled' T-Test)

You can get more information about the required inputs for each preset with the :file:`--help` flag. For example, to check the parameters for a two-sample unpaired t-test:

.. code-block:: console

    cpac group feat load-preset unpaired-two --help

This will produce:

.. include:: /user/group/feat/load-preset/unpaired-two/help.rst

Following this, you could generate a ready-to-run two-sample unpaired t-test by running the following, assuming the phenotype CSV has a column of participant IDs named "subject_id" and a column named "diagnosis", which is the covariate you wish to test:

.. code-block:: console

    cpac group feat load-preset unpaired-two /path/to/group_participant_list.txt 2.3 0.05
            /path/to/phenotypic_file.csv subject_id diagnosis grp_analysis1 
            --output-dir /path/to/output_dir

You will receive a message like this shortly after:

.. code-block:: console

    Group-level analysis participant list written:
    /path/to/output_dir/group_analysis_participants.txt

    CSV file written:
    /path/to/output_dir/cpac_group_analysis/grp_analysis1/design_matrix_grp_analysis1.csv

    CSV file written:
    /path/to/output_dir/cpac_group_analysis/grp_analysis1/contrasts_matrix_grp_analysis1.csv

    Group-level analysis configuration YAML file written:
    /path/to/output_dir/cpac_group_analysis/grp_analysis1/group_config_grp_analysis1.yml

The message indicates that all of the associated files have been generated. Most importantly, it generated a group configuration file that you can use to build and run your model. Once complete, you can review the model generated to make sure it meets your expectations. If you wish to tweak the model generated by a preset, you can load the group configuration file into the model builder (more details below) and make any modifications necessary.

When you are happy with your model, you can go ahead to build the model for each of your selected derivatives:

.. code-block:: console

    cpac group feat build-models /path/to/group_config.yml

Once this is complete, a design matrix will have been generated for each derivative, session, scan, and nuisance regression strategy you had in your pipeline directory. These are available for review in the group-level analysis output directory you specified in your group configuration file (or during preset generation). In addition, a ``contrasts.csv`` file will be generated in the top level of the FSL group model directory (in your selected group-level analysis output directory). This contrasts file will be set up in accordance with the design matrices created for your pipeline outputs, and will look like this:

.. figure:: /_images/ga_contrast_csv.png

The first column should be filled with labels for the contrasts that you can define - these do not have to follow any particular convention, and can be whatever works best for your experiment.  The remainder of the cells can be populated with contrast weights according to your needs.

If you would like to add f-tests, add each f-test as a column to the CSV with the label ``f_test_#`` and the assign weights to each contrast to be included in the f-test.

.. figure:: /_images/ga_contrast_ftest.png

Once you have specified your contrasts, you can start FSL FEAT or Randomise with the commands:

.. code-block:: console

    cpac group feat run /path/to/group_config.yml

.. code-block:: console

    cpac group feat randomise /path/to/group_config.yml

C-PAC Group Analysis Model Builder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use the model builder to create an FSL FEAT/Randomise model from scratch, or to modify any of the generated presets.

From the terminal
-----------------

Similar to the pipeline configuration YAML file, the group configuration YAML file allows you to configure your runs with key-value combinations. From terminal, you can quickly generate a default group configuration YAML file template in the directory you are in: ::

    cpac utils group-config new-template

This will generate a group configuration file that you can then modify to make your selections. See below: ::

    pipeline_dir: /path/to/output_dir


    # (Optional) Full path to a list of participants to be included in the model. You can use this to easily prune participants from your model. In group-level analyses involving phenotype files, this allows you to prune participants without removing them from the phenotype CSV/TSV file. This should be a text file with one subject per line. An easy way to manually create this file is to copy the participant ID column from your phenotype file.
