<h2>Latest Release: Version 1.7.0 Beta (Jul 4, 2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#latest-release-version-1-7-0-beta-jul-4-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>New Command Line Interface.</strong> The <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/cpac/">cpac pip-installable package</a> is now available. This CLI allows you to use C-PAC from the command line without interacting via container-based (Docker, Singularity) CLI commands.</li>
<li><strong>Anatomical Longitudinal Pipeline.</strong> C-PAC can now explicitly handle longitudinal data. The dedicated anatomical pipeline generates robust participant-specific templates that improve the registration of longitudinal data and increase reliability.<ul>
<li>[<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912002765?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912002765?via%3Dihub</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prior-Based Segmentation.</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DCAN-Labs">DCAN Labs</a> ANTS prior-based tissue segmentation is now available. This approach is thought to be advantageous in the segmentation of the non-human primate brain.<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/developmental-cognition-and-neuroimaging-lab">DCAN Labs</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://zenodo.org/record/3888969">nhp-ABCD-BIDS-pipeline</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Physiological Noise Filtering for Motion Estimates.</strong> Adapted from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DCAN-Labs">DCAN Labs</a>, C-PAC can now apply a notch filter to mitigate respiratory artifacts that may present issues in motion estimation.<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tissue Mask Ingress.</strong> In an increase of pipeline flexibility, C-PAC can now intake pre-existing anatomical tissue masks if desired, bypassing tissue segmentation. This is particularly important for researchers using manual or manually edited segmentations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pipeline speed increase: Motion correction using AFNI 3dvolreg can now be completed faster by dedicating multiple CPUs to each participant. This can provide a major speed increase in data with many TRs, as motion correction is often one of the processing time bottlenecks in a pipeline.</li>
<li>C-PAC now writes out smoothed functional time series, when spatial smoothing is chosen (previously smoothing was only applied to derivatives).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation Improvements</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The C-PAC User Guide now features versioned access! You can now view the user guide for any current or previous supported version (1.5+) of C-PAC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Error Fixes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A memory error triggered by aCompCor DetrendPC in nuisance regression has been resolved.</li>
<li>An error that sometimes prevented the pipeline from starting when censoring was enabled has been resolved.</li>
<li>An error that would prevent data configuration generation from finishing if hidden files were in the data directory
has been resolved.</li>
<li>The “SameFileError” crash has been resolved. This error did not have any impact, but it would cause many crash files to be generated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pipeline Dashboard</li>
<li>Surface-Based Processing</li>
<li>BIDS-Derivatives Compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the C-PAC Docker and Singularity images, as well as the AWS AMI, have all been updated. These provide a <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/quick.html">quick way to get started</a>.</p>

<h2>Version 1.6.2 Beta (Apr 5, 2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-6-2-beta-apr-5-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ANTs registration transformation levels and parameters are now fully customizable in the pipeline configuration.</li>
<li>Expanded Registration Forking Capability. C-PAC can now fork and simultaneously run both T1-template-based and EPI-template-based registration.</li>
<li>Expanded Motion Correction Options. FSL MCFLIRT is now available as a tool selection for motion estimation and correction, alongside AFNI 3dvolreg.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements &amp; Upgrades</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>C-PAC now runs on Python 3. During this transition, some underlying software packages, such as AFNI and ANTs, have been upgraded. Based on our release testing, performance is mostly unchanged. However, small changes can occur due to improvements made to the tools.</li>
<li>Motion estimation configurability. More motion estimation and correction parameters have been opened for configurability.</li>
<li>Increased memory efficiency and speed: C-PAC’s new default behavior for preparing time-series extraction is to realign the ROI atlases to the functional time series, instead of the other way around. This can be toggled back if desired. This change aims to cut down on memory limit errors that occur during execution with the combination of larger datasets and pipeline parallelization.</li>
<li>Increased speed: Redundant realignments of ROI atlases and the time series have also been removed.</li>
<li>The ingress of phase-difference field maps for distortion correction has been streamlined.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Error Fixes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the QC Interface, some of the template underlays would default to the MNI152 template, even if the pipeline was configured to use a custom template. This has been resolved.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue that would prevent the pipeline from starting if ICA-AROMA and blip-up/down distortion correction were both enabled, for ANTs registration-based pipelines.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue that was preventing Neurodata ndmg-f connectome graphs from being completed in some cases.</li>
<li>Resolved the “Range parameter must be finite” QC image generation crash.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the C-PAC Docker and Singularity images, as well as the AWS AMI, have all been updated. These provide a <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/quick.html">quick way to get started</a>.</p>

<h2>Version 1.6.1a Beta (Mar 6, 2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-6-1a-beta-mar-6-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>FIXES</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A hotfix has been made to correct an issue where a refined/processed version of the white matter segmentation mask was being sent to boundary-based functional-to-anatomical coregistration, instead of the raw white matter mask as intended.</li>
<li>An issue where group-level analyses weren’t pulling the required input data from the output directories of individual-level preprocessing runs has been fixed.</li>

<h2>Version 1.6.1 Beta (Feb 2, 2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-6-1-beta-feb-2-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>NEW FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Pre-configured Pipeline Library.</strong> C-PAC can now be easily run with a growing selection of pre-configured pipelines with the –preconfig flag. See the updated <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/">User Documentation</a> for the pipelines available.</li>
<li><strong>Time Series De-spiking.</strong> C-PAC can now run AFNI 3dDespike at the beginning of functional preprocessing, if enabled. <a class="reference external" href="https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dDespike.html">https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dDespike.html</a></li>
<li><strong>Smooth to a Specific FWHM.</strong> C-PAC can now run AFNI BlurToFWHM as an option, alongside the original FSL-based smoothing option. <a class="reference external" href="https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dBlurToFWHM.html">https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dBlurToFWHM.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPROVEMENTS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><strong>tCompCor Configurability.</strong> Users can now choose polynomial regression of the time series, as well as configure the degree of brain mask erosion for tCompCor nuisance regression.</li>
<li><strong>BOLD Masking Configurability.</strong> The FSL-BET option for BOLD masking now has full access to configurable parameters.</li>
<li><strong>CSF Regressor Configurability.</strong> Ventricle mask refinement of CSF masks for CSF-based nuisance regression can now be toggled.</li>
<li>More informative messages for when someone provides an incorrect AWS S3 link for input data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FIXES</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Anatomical in template space QC images are now displayed properly in the QC Interface.</li>
<li>The ‘scan’ and ‘selector’ buttons now work properly again in the QC Interface.</li>
<li>Translation and rotation motion plots are now labeled correctly.</li>
<li>A bug where the input data configuration would be formatted incorrectly when no BIDS directory JSON was present has been fixed.</li>
<li>The “start_idx” pipeline field, which allows users to select the first time point in the time series, now works properly again.</li>
<li>Fixed an error that would report a duplicate node name when running a FNIRT-based pipeline and ICA-AROMA at the same time.</li>

<div class="section" id="c-pac-v1-6-0-jan-3-2020">
<h2>C-PAC v1.6.0 (Jan 3, 2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#c-pac-v1-6-0-jan-3-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>NEW FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Anatomical-Refined BOLD Mask Generation.</strong> A new method for creating the BOLD mask is available, which uses the T1 brain mask to refine the boundaries of the generated BOLD mask.</li>
<li><strong>Carpet plots.</strong> The Quality Control interface now includes carpet plots, which are useful for rapid visual inspection for motion and other artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NEW FEATURES - Options that enhance reproducibility with fMRIPrep</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Cosine Filtering for CompCor.</strong> Users can now configure nuisance correction to perform cosine filtering on the time series data prior to CompCor calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Motion Estimation Before Slice Timing Correction.</strong> Users now have the option to calculate motion parameter estimation before slice timing correction, with actual motion correction still occurring after slice timing correction. The motion parameters go on to be used in nuisance regression and statistics reporting.</li>
<li><strong>N4 Correction for EPI.</strong> Users can now apply N4 Bias correction to the mean EPI image. This may help enhance coregistration quality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NEW FEATURES - Options that facilitate nonhuman data processing</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>EPI-Based Registration.</strong> Users can now register their BOLD data directly to an EPI template, foregoing structural-to-template registration, if desired.</li>
<li><strong>Template-Based Segmentation.</strong> Optimal for use with functional-only pipelines commonly used for rodent data, users can now employ a template-based tissue segmentation approach that applies inverse registration transforms to template-space tissue priors.</li>
<li><strong>Rodent Data compatibility.</strong> The pipeline now has an option to size-scale rodent brains to a larger size as an initial preprocessing step to prepare rodent data for processing tools.</li>
<li><strong>U-Net Brain Extraction Model.</strong> U-Net is a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) that does image segmentation. Users can now select this option for brain extraction, especially optimal for non-human primate data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPROVEMENTS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Dramatically reducing working directory size.</strong> When running aCompCor: the space requirements of the working directory has been reduced to a sustainable size. A change in the previous version resulted in too-large intermediate files for aCompCor calculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some redundancies in the pipeline during time series extraction have been removed, and the pipeline now consumes less memory and disk space during processing.</p>
<p><strong>BUG FIXES - Quality Control Interface</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Quality Control interface is fully functional once again. We apologize for the instability in recent versions, in which QC images and metrics would be generated, but the HTML portal would not generate properly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR).</strong> Exploratory, connectome-wide group-level analysis that allows researchers to explore relationships between patterns of functional connectivity and phenotypic variables. Compared to traditional univariate techniques which require rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, this multivariate approach significantly reduces the number of connectivity-phenotype comparisons needed for connectome-wide associations studies. See: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583255">A multivariate distance-based analytic framework for connectome-wide association studies.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Improved Command-Line Interface.</strong> C-PAC is now much easier to use through the command-line interface using the “cpac” CLI tool. Users can kick off individual and group-level analyses using a nested menu, generate new pipeline and data configuration files, and set up FSL FEAT model presets, all without using the Graphical User Interface. More details available <a class="reference internal" href="running"><span class="doc">here.</span></a></li>
<li><strong>Increased Skull-Stripping Configurability.</strong> You can now modify the full range of parameters for both AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip and FSL’s BET for anatomical skull-stripping during preprocessing.</li>

The first six model types are in and more to come! <a class="reference internal" href="group_analysis"><span class="doc">More details here.</span></a></li>
<li><strong>Automated Anatomical Scan Selection (for Multisession datasets).</strong> If using a dataset that features multiple anatomical/structural scans per participant, you can now configure the data configuration builder to automatically select which anatomical file to use in your pre-processing run. <a class="reference internal" href="subject_list_config"><span class="doc">More details here.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Leaner and Cleaner Output Directories.</strong> The layout of the output directory has been made cleaner and easier to navigate. Many of the usual outputs written to the output directory by default are now optional, saving disk space as well. There are new options in the pipeline configuration enabling you to select which additional outputs should be included in the output directory. Again, see the User Guide for more information on this change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Remarks</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The data configuration YAML file format has been modified to feature deeper nesting of functional-related files (such as scan parameter files or field map files).

<p>General Remarks</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Subject/Participant list YAML file has been renamed the “Data Configuration” file. What used to be named the “data config”, which contains the presets used to generate the participant list, has been renamed the “Data Settings” file. This also makes the main CPAC interface consistent with the CPAC BIDS-App. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/subject_list_config.html">User Guide section about building a data configuration file</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>
<p>New Features</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Field map distortion correction via FSL FUGUE has been introduced as a pre-processing option. Users can provide the phase difference and magnitude files required to generate the field map (if applicable) through the data configuration (participant list) builder. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/func.html#field-map-based-distortion-correction">User Guide section about distortion correction</a> for more information.</li>
<li>A new script called cpac_data_config_setup.py has been introduced, which allows users to quickly and easily create a data settings template for modification, and then use this data settings file to generate their data configuration. This script does the same thing that the data configuration builder GUI does, except without needing to be able to open the GUI (for example, when SSHing into a server). Information on its usage is available <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/subject_list_config.html#creating-the-data-configuration-file-from-terminal">here</a>.</li>
<li>When building your data configuration (participant list), input data can now be filtered by site, session, and series.</li>
<li>For building your data configuration (participant list), support for BIDS-protocol scan parameter reading from JSON files has been introduced.</li>
<li>Logging can now be disabled by entering “run_logging: False” in your pipeline configuration YAML file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Improvements</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The layout and naming of fields in the data configuration builder GUI are now clearer.</li>
<li>More informative status messages have been introduced detailing the data configuration building process (progress, amount of input data found, etc.).</li>
<li>Data configuration files (participant lists) are now ordered by site, and then participant ID, for easier searching and navigation when manually viewing or editing the YAML file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Error Fixes</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The bug in the group-level analysis model builder GUI reported earlier, where the ordering of the contrasts in the contrast matrix provided to FSL FLAME did not always match the order in which they were specified in the group model builder GUI, has been fixed.</li>
<li>An error introduced in v1.0.2 that was causing the CompCor nuisance regression strategy to not run even if it was selected in some cases, has been fixed.</li>
<li>When generating a data configuration file (participant list), a bug sometimes causing some scans to not be included in a participant entry has been fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes de-spiking could cause a crash if no volumes are marked for excessive motion.</li>
<li>The formatting of the motion parameters CSV file has been fixed.</li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>CPAC now offers De-Spiking as an option in nuisance regression, which regresses out the impact of motion-induced artifacts from the functional timeseries from volumes exhibiting motion greater than a specified threshold, without removing those volumes.</li>
<li>Users can now select which Framewise Displacement (FD) calculation to use (Jenkinson’s or Power’s) when applying the motion threshold for either Scrubbing or De-Spiking.</li>
<li>Scrubbing has been moved to the Nuisance Regression tab in the GUI’s pipeline configuration editor. The pipeline configuration YAML keys have changed for scrubbing settings. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/nuisance.html#configuration-without-the-gui">User Guide Nuisance Regression page</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/blob/v1.0.2/configs/pipeline_config.yml#L335">sample pipeline configuration file</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Re-introduced the ability to stop pipeline runs easily from the GUI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the data configuration (subject list) builder that would cause non-NIfTI files to be included if the user did not explicitly define the file extension in the file template.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the data configuration (subject list) builder where some fields would not get populated when re-loading the settings in the GUI.</li>

<h2>Version 1.0.1 Beta (Dec 5, 2016)<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0-1-beta-dec-5-2016" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The updates to CPAC in this new version include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nipype and CPAC have been updated to use a resource aware scheduler that incorporates information about the amount of memory and cores currently available when choosing a pipeline step to run. This should maximize running different pipeline steps in parallel while reducing the occurrence of out-of-memory errors and system lock-ups.</li>
<li>CPAC now calculates network centrality derivatives using the new 3dDegreeCentrality, 3dECM, and 3dLFCD AFNI tools implemented by our developers. These implementations are optimized to minimize the memory requirements while speeding up computation time. If you have an already-existing installation of AFNI that does not have these newer tools, you can update your installation by running “&#64;update.afni.binaries” from your AFNI installation directory.</li>
<li>Group-level analysis has been over-hauled to make it run more quickly, handle repeated measures, make entering contrasts more intuitive, and improve transparency in to the model generation process.</li>
<li>The BIDS data format is now supported and the participant list builder can generate a participant list given a BIDS base directory.</li>
<li>CPAC inputs can now be directly downloaded from (and outputs can be directly uploaded to) AWS S3 cloud storage.</li>
<li>For the subject list generated, we replaced the confusing “%s” identifiers in file path templates with {participant}, {site}, {session} to make generating these templates more user friendly. These identifiers are also more flexible, allowing you to combine them with substrings or include multiples, allowing for greater freedom in custom input data directory formats.</li>
<li>The GUI has been reorganized to simplify pipeline configuration, and specifically to improve handling of nuisance correction strategies and specifying ROIs for time series extraction and seed correlation analysis.</li>
<li>SLURM cluster resource scheduler compatibility added.</li>
<li>The output resolution in MNI space for statistical derivatives (e.g., ReHo, DC, etc) and 4D preprocessed functional data can be specified separately. The user can now also decide not to write the 4D preprocessed data into MNI space. Both of these steps can significantly reduce memory and disk space requirements.</li>
<li>Functional nuisance regressors data now included in the output.</li>

<h2>Version 1.0.1 Beta - 2016.12.09<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0-1-beta-2016-12-09" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Participant list builder fixes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The {participant}, {session}, etc. tags once again work properly, and are now more flexible for custom filepath formats. For example, multiple tags on one directory level, combinations of tags and custom string prefixes/suffixes, and multiple instances of the same tag in one path template are now all supported.</li>
<li>When providing a participant inclusion list (under Subjects to Include) and a site inclusion list (under Sites to Include) at the same time, the builder used to ignore the Sites to Include input. This is no longer the case and will generate an intersection of the Sites and Participant inclusion lists provided.</li>
<li>Including a scan parameters CSV containing information for multiple sites during participant list generation will no longer include scan parameters for sites not included in your data.</li>
<li>Addition of informative messages while constructing the participant list- will warn the user when a participant included in Subjects to Include does not exist or could not be found in the data, and will list these missing participant IDs.</li>
<li>When the input data does not have a session level, the participant list builder will now provide the default session “ses-1” instead of requiring a session level to be included. This is the case for both BIDS and custom data formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>Installation script updates:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Now more robust to package name differences between different versions of Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Now uses the Neurodebian ants package for all versions of Ubuntu except for 14.04.</li>
<li>Compiles libxp for Ubuntu &gt;= 16.04 for AFNI.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other updates:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The nuisance regressors are now written out to a 1D file found under “functional_nuisance_regressors” in the output directory.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where locally-stored input files would  potentially deleted if the user would use the “Test Configuration” feature with a participant list that contained both S3 links and local filepath file templates.</li>
<li>A few redundant and unnecessary directories in the individual-level analysis output directory have been removed. These were re-writes of the ANTS-based anatomical registration warp files.</li>
<li>The pipeline configuration file editor now includes the CPAC version number in the configuration YAML file.</li>
<li>More informative error messages for when there is a problem in the pipeline configuration, such as the presence of unreferenced variable names in file paths.</li>

<li>The GUI has been reorganized to simplify pipeline configuration, and specifically to improve handling of nuisance correction strategies and specifying ROIs for time series extraction and seed correlation analysis.</li>
<li>Group-level analysis has been over-hauled to make it run more quickly, handle repeated measures, make entering contrasts more intuitive, and improve transparency in to the model generation process.</li>
<li>Nipype and CPAC have been updated to use a resource aware scheduler that incorporates information about the amount of memory and cores currently available when choosing a pipeline step to run. This should maximize running different pipeline steps in parallel while reducing the occurrence of out-of-memory errors and system lock-ups.</li>
<li>The output resolution in MNI space for statistical derivatives (e.g., ReHo, DC, etc) and 4D preprocessed functional data can be specified separately. The user can now also decide not to write the 4D preprocessed data into MNI space. Both of these steps can significantly reduce memory and disk space requirements.</li>
<li>Improved logging.</li>
<li>Column names of ROI time series files and file names for SCA outputs are now based on the unique identifier used for the ROI in the corresponding atlas, making it easier to relate the files back to the ROIs.</li>
<li>For the subject list generated, we replaced the confusing “%s” identifiers in file path templates with {participant}, {site}, {session} to make generating these templates more user friendly.</li>
<li>Added support for BIDS file structure.</li>

<h2>Version 0.3.9 Alpha (Apr 4, 2015)<a class="headerlink" href="#version-0-3-9-alpha-apr-4-2015" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please consult the <a class="reference external" href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/index.html">User Guide</a> for a full description of the new features and changes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Major group analysis model builder upgrades:<ul>
<li>F-tests are now fully integrated into the new model builder GUI.</li>
<li>Users can now provide their own custom, hand-coded contrasts matrix if they do not wish to use the model builder’s contrast dialog.</li>
<li>The “mean of measure” regressor option can now be calculated using a specified mask, in addition to the option of using an automatically created mask for each individual.</li>
<li>A custom ROI mask file can now be provided with one or more ROIs - the mean of these ROIs will then be calculated and included as regressors in the model. This will enable for example, including seperate regressors for white matter and CSF.</li>
<li>The statistical derivatives to be analyzed can now be specified for each group model, allowing the user more flexibility for using different group models (i.e. include different nuisance regressors) for different derivatives.</li>

<h2>Version 0.1.1 Alpha - 2012.10.15<a class="headerlink" href="#version-0-1-1-alpha-2012-10-15" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Scrubbing:</strong> Users can now specify the number of TRs that should be removed before and after an offending TR.</li>
<li><strong>Scrubbing:</strong> C-PAC now prints a warning specifying the number of time points left after scrubbing. If no time points are left, C-PAC will crash and print an error.</li>
<li><strong>Slice Timing:</strong> Users can now specify which sites are run with slice timing correction.</li>
<li><strong>Slice Timing:</strong> Slice timing correction is now able to read slice timing information directly from an image file, and works on Multiband sequences.</li>
<li><strong>Timeseries:</strong> Users can now specify a different number of initial TRs to be removed for each site.</li>
<li><strong>Data Config:</strong> Data extraction now works for the NKI-TRT data set, and automatically extracts scan parameters for each subject from the image file.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> C-PAC no longer crashes if dot is not installed. Instead, it prints an error and contines running.</li>
