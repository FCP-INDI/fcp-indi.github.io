Workflow
````````

A workflow accomplishes a particular processing task (e.g. functional preprocessing, scrubbing, nuisance correction). Each workflow can be turned on or off in the pipeline ~:py:class:`Configuration`.  Sometimes a workflow can be set to both on and off, allowing for pipelines to branch.
