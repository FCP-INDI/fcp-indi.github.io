Branches
********

Please, always base changes on the ``source`` branch. ``main`` branch will be overwritten by the CI deployment.

Versions
""""""""

``nightly``
```````````

Pushes to ``source`` will rebuild docs at https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/nightly

C-PAC release tags
``````````````````

Tags in the format ``v.*-source`` will build docs for the given version.

If a matching version tag doesn't exist in https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/tags, the build should fail.

Steps to build a release:

#. Checkout a commit from the ``source`` from a time appropriate for documentation for the branch being built/rebuilt.
#. If you need to make changes, create a branch (\ ``git switch -c`` or ``git checkout -b`` ).
#. Make any changes you need for the specific version.
#. Tag the commit that's ready to build (\ ``git tag v`` version\ ``-source`` )
#. (Force) push to the remote tag (\ ``git push origin v`` version\ ``-source`` ).
#. CircleCI should deploy the versioned documentation. If the version tag is the newest, it should also overwrite ``latest`` with these documents.

Guidelines
**********

* Only write a document once, and liberally use the |rst include|_ to include that document where appropriate.
* Use absolute paths for ``.. include::`` s. That way the path will resolve correctly regardless of differences in nesting levels.
* Include any source documents that you want built in at least one |toctree|_. Use the ``:hidden:`` option if you don't want it linked in an actual table of contents in the document with the ``toctree``.
* Use consistent section title indicators throughout a sourcetree. `fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user <https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user>`_ currently has the following hierarchy (top to bottom):

  .. code-block::

     =
     ^
     -
     *
     #
     `
     '
     "

Building
""""""""

Let CircleCI build your drafts / works-in-progress
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

* Build environment will match actual docs build environment
* CircleCI takes ~2 minutes to build

#. Fork https://github.com/FCP-INDI/fcp-indi.github.io
#. In your fork's settings, set the GitHub Pages ``source`` to ``main`` branch

   .. image:: ./images/github-pages-settings-example.png
      :target: ./images/github-pages-settings-example.png
      :alt: GitHub Pages settings example screenshot

#. Add your project on CircleCI
#. Merge your draft / work-in-progress into your fork's ``source`` branch. Make sure you push to your fork and not the main repository's ``source`` branch.
#. Your fork will publish at ``https://[your_GitHub_username].github.io/fcp-indi.github.io/``.

Build locally (C-PAC â‰¥ v1.8.0)
``````````````````````````````

This documentation aspires to rely on a `single source of truth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth>`_ where possible.  To this end, building this documentation requires an installation of the version of `C-PAC <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC>`_ that is being documented.

Steps to build this documentation locally:

#. Clone `this repository`_.
#. *(optional)* Locally replicate the step "ðŸ‘Š Running cpac commands" from ``.circleci/config`` to generate `cpac <https://pypi.org/project/cpac/>`_ usage strings.
    Either perform this "ðŸ‘Š Running cpac commands" step in a separate Python environment or uninstall cpac after generating the usage string(s).

   #. *(optional)* Create an environment for cpac and activate this environment.
   #. ``pip install cpac``
   #. If you don't have a local container for the version of C-PAC you're documenting, ``cpac pull`` to download the latest or ``cpac pull --tag $TAG`` to pull a specific version.
   #. Generate ReStructuredText documents with cpac usage strings:

      .. code-block:: BASH

          mkdir -p docs/_sources/user/cpac
          printf ".. code-block:: console\n\n   $ cpac --help\n\n" > docs/_sources/user/cpac/help.rst
          cpac --help | sed -e "s/.*/   &/" >> docs/_sources/user/cpac/help.rst
          mkdir -p docs/_sources/user/run
          printf "Usage: cpac run\n\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ cpac run --help\n\n" > docs/_sources/user/run/help.rst
          cpac run --help | sed -e "s/.*/   &/" >> docs/_sources/user/run/help.rst
          mkdir -p docs/_sources/user/utils
          printf "Usage: cpac utils\n\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ cpac utils --help\n\n" > docs/_sources/user/utils/help.rst
          cpac utils --help | sed -e "s/.*/   &/" >> docs/_sources/user/utils/help.rst

   #. ``deactivate`` your cpac environment if you used a separate environment or ``pip uninstall cpac``.

#. Locally install `C-PAC`_ from source.
#. Run ``./bin/build $VERSION`` where ``$VERSION`` is the version to build (\ ``nightly`` , ``latest`` , or |semver| for production, but this string can be anything you want locally).

Flowcharts
**********

* SVGs exported from Lucidchart have scaling coded in in ``width`` and ``height`` XML attributes. Add the XML attributes ``preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet"`` and ``viewBox`` to the SVG element in the actual SVG files:

.. code-block:: xml

   <svg preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet" viewBox="0 0 {width} {height}"></svg>

where ``{width}`` and ``{height}`` are the values already present in the existing ``width`` and ``height`` XML attributes.


* Load SVGs in HTML ``object`` elements with the ``raw:: html`` directive to preserve hyperlinks and scaling:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. raw:: html

       <object data="../_static/path/to/chart.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Tutorials
*********

See `FCP-INDI/C-PAC_tutorials/CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC_tutorials/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for how to contribute tutorials. Add them to the TOC tree in that repository or in any TOC tree in `this repository`_ with a relative path beginning ``/user/tutorials/`` (e.g., ``/user/tutorials/observed_usage`` for |observed_usage|_\ ).

References and citations
************************

`sphinxcontrib-bibtex <https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/>`_ is installed and configured. This extension creates links between the citations and the reference in the reference list and formats citations in referenced BibTeX files using built-in or `custom styles <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/fcp-indi.github.io/blob/source/docs/_sources/references/style.py>`_. To use this Sphinx extension,


#. Include your references in a BibTeX file. Unless you have a speficic reason to use a separate file, that BibTeX file should be |references.bib|_.
#. If the entry type (e.g., ``book`` , ``article`` , ``misc`` ) of any of the entries in your BibTeX file(s) is not included in `docs/_sources/references/style.py <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/fcp-indi.github.io/blob/source/docs/_sources/references/style.py>`_\ , add a ``get_{entry_type}_template`` `Pybtex <https://pybtex.org>`_ method to ``CPAC_DocsStyle``.
#. If you want to include a header over a reference list, either follow the heirarchy under `the Guidelines section of this document <#guidelines>`_ or use the ``.. rubric::`` directive above its ``.. bibliography`` directive.

Local bibliography
""""""""""""""""""

For a bibliography of just the citations on the current page. This is the bibliography style you probably want, unless you have a specific reason for the central bibliography style.

#. Using the key (the text between the opening ``{`` and the first ``,`` in a BibTeX entry) use the ReStructuredText syntax |footcite example| to cite your reference in a ReStructuredText file.
#. Somewhere below your citations in the same page, place ``.. footbibliography::``. You can use this directive multiple times.

   .. epigraph::

      If specified multiple times in the same document, footnotes are only created for references that do not yet have a footnote earlier in the document.

      -- https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/2.4.2/usage.html#directive-footbibliography

Central bibliography
""""""""""""""""""""

For a bibliography that includes references from multiple pages,

#. Include a ``.. bibliography::`` directive somewhere on any page that you want to use this extension to format references and create two-way links between the references and citations. You can list uncited references by listing their BibTeX keys explicilty.
#. If you will (or might) use more than one ``.. bibliography::`` directive (including via ``.. include::`` directives), choose a prefix for the keys and include that prefix in both the ``:cite:`` role (like |prefix-key example| ) and the bibliography directive (like ``:keyprefix: prefix-`` ).

For example, if you have a BibTeX file called ``cpac_citation.bib`` that contains

.. code-block:: BibTeX

   @ARTICLE{cpac2013,
       AUTHOR={Craddock, Cameron  and  Sikka, Sharad  and  Cheung, Brian  and  Khanuja, Ranjeet  and  Ghosh, Satrajit S

   To cite C-PAC, use :cite:`cite-example-cpac2013`.

   .. rubric Cite C-PAC

   .. bibliography::
      :cited:
      :keyprefix: cite-example-

â€¦the rendered file should look something like

   .. raw:: html

      <p>To cite C-PAC, use <a name="backref1" href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

      <div><p><b>Cite C-PAC</b></p>

The local bibliography method to generate the same rendered output:

.. code-block:: rst

   To cite C-PAC, use :footcite:`cpac2013`.

   .. rubric Cite C-PAC

   .. footbibliography::

If you want to generate that bibliography entry without the citation:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. bibliography::
      :cited:

      cpac2013

Environment notes
*****************

* Because `C-PAC`_ and `cpac`_ have conflicting commandline commands, we first run any ``cpac`` commands in a virtual environment and spoof the ``command-output`` directive with ``code-block`` like

  .. code-block:: RST

      .. code-block:: console

          cpac run --help

      .. program-output:: cpac_py run --help
         :shell:
         :ellipsis: 0,9

* |:heavy_plus_sign:| Check |circleci config|_ of the branch you're working from for build dependencies.

* |:octocat:| Set an environment variable ``GITHUBTOKEN`` to a `personal access token <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line>`_ to increase `your API rate limit <https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting>`_ from 60 to 5000 requests per hour (for getting `release notes from GitHub <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/releases>`_\ ).
